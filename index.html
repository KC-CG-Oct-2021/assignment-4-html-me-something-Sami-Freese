         <h2>Excerpt from <a href="https://www.samifreese.com/good-manners" title="On my old website, which contains old poems">Good Manners:</a></h2>
         <blockquote class="poem">I was raised to be a gentleman in an old movies<br>
         To open doors for people, and offer them<br>
         drinks and charming conversation<br>
         About what I has just been reading<br>
         To remember my companions interests<br>
         And to be gracious about everything<br></blockquote>
         <h2>Tiffany's Table Manners For Teans<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> reminds us:</h2>
         <p><q>...that a dinner party is not a funeral, nor has your hostess invited you because she thinks you are in dire need of food. You're there to be entertaining. Be gay. Do your part. Don't be a gloom" </q></p>
         <h2>Tiffany's also says that:</h2>
         <p><q>Asparagus is eaten with the finters, unless stalks are too long. If the asparagus is long and thin, cut off the ends with your fork held in your right hand... You will then avoid imitating a trained seal.</q></p>
         <p class="prose">This is backed up by <u><b> Blue Book of Etiquite for Men</b></u> <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>from 1905:</p>
         <p><q>Asparagus may be taken in the fingers, but the more elegant mode of eating it is to cutt off the tips with a fork and convey them to the mouth upon it.</q></p>
         <p class="prose"><b><u>The Blue Book of Etiquite for Men</u></b> also tells us eating corn on the cob with your hands is <q>a barbarous practice at best</q> and further tells us that breakfasts are <q>distinctly feminie affars</q>, whatever that means, and also discribs the ideal man's morning routine involves excercise <i>after</i> baithing, and then taking your sweet time getting dressed, pausing between articles of clothing to read a few lines from a book you have open on the dresser.</p>
         <p class="prose">This is a practice I have adopted myself, except that instead of a novel or something respectable, I'm looking at tweets on my phone.</p>
         <h2>More on Asparagus:</h2>
         <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">My family moved around a lot when I was growing up, but for a few years we lived in a house in Prarie Village, Kansas that had a well established aspargus patch. Every spring my mother would harvest them, and we would take boxes full to her sisters when we went to visit them in Pensilvania.</p>
         <p class="prose">In this same house I became my father's daughter, learning to change the oil and rotate the tires, and riding in the back seet while he tried to teach my mother to drive his vintage, manual transmission Mustang.</p>
         <p class="prose">Years later, 21 and in a different house, my Dad would send me out with my mother in the passanger seat. Having had a few lessons in driving a car with a manual transmission, he thought I would be fine to practice around the neighborhood without him. At one point, I got stuck, trying to go up hill at a four way intersection. The old man who lived in the house on the corner came out and yelled through the car window, <q>Are you learning to drive stick? Sometimes, you just have to gun it!</q> he stepped back and then yelled <q>Gun it! Gun it!</q> until I made it through the intersection.</p>
